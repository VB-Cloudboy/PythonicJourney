# Pythonic Journey
Evokes the idea of embarking on a Python adventure. A repository containing small, useful Python code snippets.

## Summary

Get started with Python! Learn how to create programs and projects in Python. Work with strings, lists, loops, dictionaries, and functions.

Learn Python basics, including the following elements:

- Boolean types
- Strings
- Mathematical operations
- Lists and loops
- Dictionaries
- Functions
- Error checking
- Get familiar with Jupyter notebooks

## NOTES

### Module-1: Intro 2 Python

1. Learn to write a few lines of Python code, declare variables, and work with console input and output
2. Created in early 1990. It can be used from automating repetitive tasks and writing web apps to building machine learning models and implementing neural networks.
3. Packages are shared code libraries that are freely available for anyone to use.
4. Simple to learn the syntax, It can run on almost any computer including Winddows, Mac & Linux.
5. 2 ways to execute python code (a) Interactive mode - each command you type is interpreted and executed immediately, and you see the results each time you press ENTER. (b) Script mode - In script mode, you put a set of Python statements into a text file with a .py extension. You then run the python interpreter and point it at the file. The program is executed line by line, and the output is displayed.\
6. Python is licensed under the OSI open-source license, and there are several implementations available depending on your needs. (a) CPython, the reference implementation - is commonly used for web development, application development, and scripting. (b) Anaconda - Specifically for data science and machine learning. (c) Iron Python - Iron Python is an open-source implementation of Python built on the .NET runtime. (d) Jupyter Notebook - Jupyter Notebooks are widely used in research and academia for mathematical modeling, machine learning, statistical analysis, and for teaching and learning how to code. 
7. Don't want to create a file to execute your code, use built-in program called REPL. which lets you type shorter statements and have those statements evaluated."This experience is sometimes referred to as a "Read-Eval-Print-Loop", or REPL"
8. Variables are one of the fundamental building block of programs written in Python. It holds data in memory. Variables have types (string & Integer) & operator (+ & -) Assignment operator (=)
9. There are many ways to send input to a python program; two common ways are via a graphical interface or a console.
