'''
To express conditional logic in Python, you use if statements. 
When you're writing an if statement, you're relying on another concept we cover in this module, mathematical operators. 
Python supports the common logic operators from math: equals, not equals, less than, less than or equal to, greater than, and 
greater than or equal to. You're probably used to seeing these operators displayed using symbols, 
which is how theyâ€™re represented in Python, too.
'''

a = 97
b = 45
# test expression
if a >= b:
    #statement to be run
    print(a)

'''
You use an if statement if you want to run code only if a certain condition is satisfied. 
The syntax of an if statement is always:
'''
a = 93
b = 27
if a >= b:
    print(a)

c = 24
d = 44
if c <= 0:
    print(a)
print(b)
